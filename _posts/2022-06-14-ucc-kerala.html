<p>The session today started with the the parliament trying to find  proper implementation methods of UCC to which senior BJP ministers like Mr. modi and Ms Nupur Sharma suggested to make a prototype of the UCC rules by making a committee having “proportionate” representation political party members and religious members , this “ proportionate “ was questioned by the congress leader and raised many speculation of how the BJP is trying to ‘HINDUFY’ the country.<p>

<p>BJP leaders also suggested the implementation should be trial for 3 years in the states of kerala ,west bengal .This suggestion faced strong backlash from the opposition leaders .Mr. Owaisi rightly opposed it with the argument  that BJP’s selection of states is not “random” owaisi points out how they have selected the states not ruled by BJP so that riots which follow (which are inevitable ) will be blamed on the state , on this note PM modi even commented that if the riots are violent they won't hesitate to put an emergency which essentially puts the center in charge<p>

<p>Press conference followed in the later part of the day where NDTV reporters had the chance to interview the all talented and sensible BJP minister Mr. Tejaswi Surya . when asked about how can the people of the nation trust him and the BJP while making the rules for UCC after openly giving  the remarks about how muslim religioun is so impractical and making fun of many sharia laws , he stubornly replied to this question that since the people have voted him they have to trust him even if he gives nasty remarks on muslim laws.<p>

<p>And when asked about his views on an incident in uttar pradesh he replied with i don't care about uttar pradesh ,i am from bangalore , as if the UCC (if implemented )will be implemented only in his constituencies and not in the entire nation.<p>

<p>In the press conference the prime minister of the nation Mr. Narendra Damodar Modi  didn’t had answers to most questions asked by the press (maybe he is out of practice in attending press conferences ) but he was very confident in speaking in support of Ms Nupur “controversy” Sharma about the nasty remarks she gave on prophet mohammed , He defended Ms Sharma calling her remarks as freedom of speech (offensive speech never existed ) . Modi ji did this after Nupur Sharma had openly accepted that her suspension from the party was correct .<p>

<p>This shows how the BJP represents itself as a secular party and then like a snake shed its skin and show its true color.<p>

<p>Now the question is Will the parliament come to a conclusion on the final day , will the all efficient speakers of the BJP be able to brainwash the parliament with their supposedly “right” ideas or will the UCC remain a myth as it always has been …<p>
