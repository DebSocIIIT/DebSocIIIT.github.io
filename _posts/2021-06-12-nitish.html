<p>Nitish Kumar finally broke his silence on UCC matters in the 2nd parliamentary session by bashing BJP for trying to implement UCC in Bihar, which according to him isn’t a wise move.</p>

<p>The CM further elaborated that implementing UCC will be disastrous in Bihar as it would instigate the already polarized communities and incite riots. Moreover, he mentioned that implementing UCC will be detrimental towards protecting minorities and would impact freedom of religion.</p>

<p>In the interview, Nitish Kumar mentioned that Bihar is going through a delicate state and he wouldn’t want anything that will tip the fragile balance and lead to violence.</p>

<p>All of this brings out the discord within JDU in recent years. In April 2022, a JDU minister, Ashok Chaudhary, who is Nitish Kumar’s aide said that Bihar didn’t need UCC as the state is very peaceful. </p>

<p>The aforementioned statement was in stark contrast to the CM’s views, and upon being questioned about it, he replied that his opinion differs from those in his own party. This brings up the question - is JDU working towards bringing Bihar out of its “fragile” state, when its own MLAs live in ignorance?</p>

<p>The CM made no comments on the future of UCC in Bihar, but had previously written to the Law Commission regarding the same, in which he pressed that UCC, though useful, must be delayed in Bihar.</p>
