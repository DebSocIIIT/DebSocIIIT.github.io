<p>The session of lok sabha started with general speakers speech where members of the bharatiya janata party like Anurag Thakur stated that the if UCC is made, it will comprehend the religious beliefs of all the religion , the newly made aviation minister jyotiraditya scindia who recently switched party from congress to BJP spoke on how the UCC won't be dominated by “any” religion .</p>

<p>The recently suspended spokesperson Nupur Sharma also talked about how everyone should be under one umbrella but faced strong backlash from the opposition leaders like VIJAYAN that nupur sharma herself gave a very controversial remark on prophet which is being acknowledged all over the world and Mr. Vijayan also talks about how BJP keeps naming the cities according to a “particular” religion and how there are many cases of religion bias in BJP ruling states . He supposedly concreted his claim in front of the executive board that the Uniform civil code made by the ruling party won't be that uniform ….</p>

<p>But in totally contrast to the above claims by the BJP ministers about the UCC being not biased MR. tejaswi Surya who was punished for 15 min silence in the lok sabha where he was downvoted by his own party members on a point to reply , he openly stated that how the muslims laws were totally impractical and claimed the superiority of hindu laws , he even said “Teen-Teen shadiyan karne se pehle kuch kaam kar lete hai ” while addressing Mr Owasii.</p>

<p>In the moderated caucus on the topic “if not UCC then what ”</p>

<p>Mr. nitin gadkari says that their parties main focus will be on eradicating “unfair or evil “ practices from the religious laws but was rightly opposed by shree Rahul Gandhi that the norms of “evil” are being judged by BJP. He gives example of beef ban in BJP led UTTAR PRADESH where beef was evil according to a “particular” religion so the claims of evil and not evil are totally controversial.</p>

<p>On an interesting note Mr. Jamyang Namgyal was captured sleeping in the parliament during his "own" Prime minister Narendra Modi's speech.</p>
