<p>Badruddin Ajmal provided The Hindu with an exclusive peek at the bill he proposes to publish in the Lok Sabha -</p>

The scheme we need to follow to solve the pertinent question:

<ol>
    <li>Draft a UCC.</li>
    <li>Decide cases of personal law in the following manner:
        <ol>
            <li>Ask each of the parties what law system they would like to follow</li>
            <li>If there is a unanimous consensus on a particular law system, use it. If not, use the UCC.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

This system will preserve the freedom of religion as well as uphold the
fundamental rights of everyone, including women and minorities.

Example illustrating point ii)

Suppose there is a personal law case pertaining to marriage. Then each of the
parties in the case must choose between

<ol>
    <li> The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 </li>
    <li> The Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872 </li>
    <li> The Parsi Marriage and Divorce Act of 1936 </li>
    <li> Muslim Marriage Act </li>
    <li> Any other religious laws </li>
    <li> The Uniform Civil Code, 2022 </li>
</ol>

<p>If ALL the parties are in agreement on one of these options, then the agreed upon law should be the law used to decide the case.</p>

<p>Else The Uniform Civil Code, 2022 shall be used.</p>

<p>The MP proposes drafting a UCC, then debating over each and every law in personal laws with representation from all political parties, and if a unanimous decision is not achieved, a suitable clause from the UCC draft shall be implemented across India.</p>

<p>However, the proposed bill neither specifies the contents of the UCC, nor does it hint upon the members that will be a part of the drafting committee.</p>

<p>Moreover, the cause of accommodating each and every minority in India, including women, hasn’t been discussed in the draft we received.</p>
