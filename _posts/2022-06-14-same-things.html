<p>The second day of the Lok Sabha picks up from where the first one ended. Some more barbs regarding implementation of UCC are traded, and a point of contention is about the initial implementation of UCC being in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, communally diverse states which are governed by the BJP. The opposition questions why a phased rollout, and why in states governed by the BJP. The central government’s response points out that a phased rollout helps to observe how well it works, and the practical difficulties faced can be fixed in the subsequently chosen states. The reason for choosing those states is that the central government would prefer working with co-operative state governments, and not those who would seek to complain and create hurdles at every turn and delay the process at every turn, an example being the TMC government in West Bengal.<p>

<p>Another ‘problem’ brought up was that Uttar Pradesh had the lowest Human Development Index (HDI) in India, which is objectively untrue and was fact-checked by UP CM Yogi Adityanath. Modiji closed by asking the pertinent question of where his concerns ought to lie, in the safety and happiness of women or in what Sharia law or the Holy Bible say?<p>

<p>The assembly then broke for an unmoderated caucus. Amazingly, AIUDF chief Badruddin Ajmal, who is regularly listed among <a href="https://themuslim500.com/profiles/badruddin-ajmal-qasmi/">"The 500 Most Influential Muslims" of the world</a>, was heard saying ‘India is not a nice country, there are much nicer countries,’ with Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi repeatedly asking him to ‘shut up, the press is right here.’<p>

<p>After the unmoderated caucus, there were some crisis updates, which caused quite a stir. Foremost among them was the fact that RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had stated that he was excited to join the special committee of the UCC. The opposition made quite a meal of this statement even after it was clarified that he was simply one of those considered for it, and that there would be equal representation for all.<p>

<p>Mamata Bannerjee and Arvind Kejriwal threatened to go to the Supreme Court even though the matter was still under discussion in the House. Kejriwal also made the distractionary demand of statehood for Delhi. The BJP revealed that it had modified its original plan to now implement UCC first in West Bengal, Kerala, Kashmir, and Uttar Pradesh after consultation with the opposition, indicating that they are and have been open to constructive criticism.<p>

<p>One of the most controversial speeches of the day came towards the end and was made by TMC MP Mahua Moitra, who asked, “Do you think Indians have the brains to follow  UCC laws? India is going to lawless and weak cowards… Indians don’t have listening skills and have a short attention span.” One wonders why the representative felt the need to be so provocative in her speech, and what she intended to achieve.<p>

<p>The day closed with an open press conference. Turn to Page 2 for  our coverage.<p>
