While it was an enthusiastic session with participation from most of the Members of the Parliament voicing their concerns regarding the Uniform Civil Code, it was apparent that the opposition was not able to provide convincing alternatives to UCC if not UCC, and continued vouching for the age-old discriminatory laws.</p>

<p>The session started with the Motion proposed by the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, a UCC advocate, “framework and implementation of UCC”.</p>

<p>Towards the beginning of the session, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi backed up his previous statements by portraying strong approval towards implementing the Uniform Civil Code for all the citizens of India. He said, “India is a nation of peace and acceptance. people are arrogant to assume personal laws are superior.” He claimed that the “heavenly laws” made about 2000 years ago were discriminatory towards women and the less fortunate people of the society and UCC would ensure they are given rights.</p>

<p>On a rather interesting note, Asaduddin Owaisi explicitly said that the UCC would take away rights from women. He quoted that, “Hindu women have certain privileges that the UCC would in fact withdraw”. The panel of BJP MPs objected to this completely false statement. Owaisi seemed to have incorrectly learned and interpreted the UCC, as Anurag Thakur backed up, “UCC takes into consideration the current personal laws and does not take them away.“</p>

<p>Owaisi was further questioned by the right-leaning MPs when he mentioned, “Polygamy among Hindus was in fact more than the polygamy found in Muslims”. This statement not only baffled the panel of members of the parliament, but left the audience, press, and the speaker perplexed. Upon being questioned about his sources, he mentioned and we quote “1954 census reported this.” These laughable comments were visibly cross-examined by the audience as it left them confused.</p>

<p>MP Manoj Tiwari, remarkably convinced his point that the opposition has based their entire problems on the implementations of UCC and has not rather given a thought about the overall picture and how beneficial it could be. He conveyed his message by using quite an interesting “pizza” analogy. He reinstated that we are all Indian citizens above all and that existence of personal identity will not be harmed, which the opposition seemed to have forgotten.</p>

<p>Admittedly going against his own party’s stated position Tharoor, in fact, backed the idea proposed by BJP. He said, “this law has the capability of giving women and the people of the LGBTQ community rights.” He also received support and applause from the ruling party for stating, “One nation, One Law”.</p>

<p>During the second motion, “If not UCC, then what?” proposed by Scindia, it became apparent that the opposition had no clear idea about what they had in mind if not UCC. According to spokesperson Manoj Tiwari, “opposition’s policy is completely redundant and they should just go along with UCC. Implementation of UCC is also a matter of debate. Stating and wording UCC in a different way is not suggesting an alternative.”</p>

<p>Today’s session, although was only the first of the many to come, made the picture very clear. The ruling party had a sharp vision of the UCC and its framework, however, the opposition, confused, could not give good enough alternatives to UCC, nor could completely criticise UCC.</p>]]></content><author><name>Republic TV</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Lok Sabha Assembly’s first day marked a rather enthusiastic session.

<p>The recently suspended spokesperson Nupur Sharma also talked about how everyone should be under one umbrella but faced strong backlash from the opposition leaders like VIJAYAN that nupur sharma herself gave a very controversial remark on prophet which is being acknowledged all over the world and Mr. Vijayan also talks about how BJP keeps naming the cities according to a “particular” religion and how there are many cases of religion bias in BJP ruling states . He supposedly concreted his claim in front of the executive board that the Uniform civil code made by the ruling party won't be that uniform ….</p>

<p>But in totally contrast to the above claims by the BJP ministers about the UCC being not biased MR. tejaswi Surya who was punished for 15 min silence in the lok sabha where he was downvoted by his own party members on a point to reply , he openly stated that how the muslims laws were totally impractical and claimed the superiority of hindu laws , he even said “Teen-Teen shadiyan karne se pehle kuch kaam kar lete hai ” while addressing Mr Owasii.</p>

<p>In the moderated caucus on the topic “if not UCC then what ”</p>

<p>Mr. nitin gadkari says that their parties main focus will be on eradicating “unfair or evil “ practices from the religious laws but was rightly opposed by shree Rahul Gandhi that the norms of “evil” are being judged by BJP. He gives example of beef ban in BJP led UTTAR PRADESH where beef was evil according to a “particular” religion so the claims of evil and not evil are totally controversial.</p>

<p>On an interesting note Mr. Jamyang Namgyal was captured sleeping in the parliament during his "own" Prime minister Narendra Modi's speech.</p>

The topic of discussion was the Uniform Civil Code(UCC). The first couple of hours consisted of banal back-and-forth between the opposition and the government, with all representatives making the same points – the opposition stating, “you can’t impose your rules on other communities,” and the government enlightening them: “ Many of the personal laws are prejudiced against women in general. Hence, we must have a uniform code to ensure parity for all.”</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/09.jpg" alt="Image">

<p>The opposition mentioned that the implementation of UCC in Goa(a BJP-ruled state) was imperfect and “not actually uniform”, but Minister of Finance Sitharaman sets them straight by womansplaining to them that those laws were brought about by the Portuguese, and honestly it’s unreasonable to blame the current government for them.</p>

<p>Nitin Gadkari asked the pertinent question of human rights taking precedence over all other rights and choice. He said that you can still practise your own religion, but the evil laws should be rid of. This is true even of Hinduism, as in the case of Sati. However, Akhilesh Yadav took offence to Gadkari’s unapologetic usage of the word ‘evil’, raised a right to reply… AND LOST. like a bich. So he had to shut up for 15 minutes</p>

<p>Next up, Manoj Tiwari made an interesting analogy about a son not wanting pizza from Domino’s when asked if he wanted to order online(he compared this with the opposition discussing the implementation of UCC when they hadn’t even decided if UCC would be implemented), and Vijayan responded by saying they don’t want pizza at all. (I know, right? What a weirdo. Whatever. More pizza for the rest of us) The overarching theme seemed to be that the opposition wanted a UCC, but were not in favour of the ruling party formulating it, as their laws were apparently “hInDu-BiAsEd”.</p>

<p>Amidst all this, Yogiji raised his hand to speak, but the rapporteur ignored him >:( that’s strike one.</p>

<p>Shashi Tharoor started talking again, and disrespected Tejaswi Surya. What he didn’t realise was that he had forgotten his haute “accent”. Thanks to the rapporteur for pointing that out. You’re off the hook. For now. We break for an hour.</p>

<p>The topic for the second session is “If not UCC, then what?”</p>

<p>We’re supposed to hear the alternatives the opposition has to a UCC. (Spoiler: none of them are any good)</p>

<p>Rahul Gandhi pipes up, and stumbles through his speech. Elmayo noob. His own associates disturb his speech, showing a lack of unity and coordination in Congress and the opposition as a whole. He takes the metaphor in a completely new (and nonsensical) direction by bringing up pineapple on pizza</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/img/posts/08.png" alt="Image">

<p>I mean, you’d think an Italian would know better than to defile pizza like that, but okay, I guess.</p>

<p>Then the opposition comes up with a frankly quite dumb idea of giving people in each case a choice of whether they wanted to allow UCC to apply to them. Any intelligent reader would be able to tell that that defeats the purpose of a uniform civil code.</p>

<p>Something to note is that Asaduddin Owaisi coughs very loudly in assembly, thereby
<ul>
    <li> breaking decorum and </li>
    <li> putting his fellow delegates (and more importantly, the press) in danger of falling ill.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>He then proceeds to address the honourable Prime Minister as ‘shrimati’ instead of ‘shriman’, a blatant act of disrespect for the representative of the nation. Then he accidentally provides a ringing endorsement of Modiji by  pointing out that Benares has a 30% Muslim population, and yet Modiji one. This can only mean that Our Dear Leader is loved by all – regardless of what seditious elements may say.</p>

<p>Farooq Abdullah brings up the Special Marriage Act of 1954 in the context of inter-faith marriages, but what he perhaps doesn’t know is that there are a lot of flaws with the act, such as any person being allowed to object to the marriage upto THIRTY DAYS from the marriage being filed.</p>
<p>There was another embarrassing moment for the opposition as Arvind Kejriwal continued his hapless day where he went against everything he’s said in the past, by appearing to question Asaduddin Owaisi, even though he’s not, you know, supposed to be doing that. <p>
</p>There was another right to reply instance where the Hyderabad MP used allegations which had been dropped against Tejaswi Surya, to question his integrity. Tejaswi lost, and was silenced for 15 minutes.<p>
</p>Meanwhile, Kejriwal manages to group reservation in with corruption and police brutality as issues to be fixed. Honestly just a bad day all around for him. <p>
</p>Modi and P- Rahul Gandhi have a debate where RaGa suggests that Modi focus on fixing the legal system first before he implements UCC. Modi thanks him for his  ingenious solution of fixing the legal system, but he believes that that is not in the list of things he is supposed to do, so no, he will focus on UCC instead. <p>
</p>Then we reached the most entertaining part of the day as Ramesh Pokhriyal and Mamata Bannerjee kept making barbs at each other’s positions and the speaker was hapless until both were gagged. <p>
</p>However, Pokhriyal did manage to make some points. He introduced educational reforms – abolishing madrassas would prevent brainwashing and provide knowledge that could actually be used. In his opinion, shutting down madrassas would be more important than shutting down gurukuls. He also claimed(rightly) that Ramayan and Mahabharat teach us about the history of India. He made a parliamentary enquiry for a mic to drop, was denied, and promptly left. As will I. BYE<p>

<p>PS: I managed to snag a short interview with Rahul Gandhi. Here’s how it went:
<ul>
<li>He said he was strongly opposed to the UCC, but hadn’t spoken out until now because he felt that the word of other senior Congress leaders would have been enough</li>
<li>He believed me when I said Priyanka Gandhi(his sister) had spoken out against UCC (she hadn’</li>
<li>He is of the opinion that the BJP is creating a “politics of polarisation” which will be a “central challenge” in India</li>
<li>He seemed unable to adequately explain his remarks of “I am a Hindu… India belongs to the Hindus”</li>
</ul>

<p>In a dramatic development, Nupur Sharma appeared in public for the first time after her infamous incident, to be a part of this Lok Sabha session. She engaged in the session as if she hadn’t recently been part of the biggest religious scandal in a while.</p>

<p>There seemed to be incompetence all around. Multiple MPs spent more time on asking how the motions and points worked, rather than being a part of fruitful discussion. Special mention can be given to Manohar Lal Khattar, who didn’t utter a single word apart from the “Present” in the roll call. Even the rapporteur was messing up while noting down names for the speaker’s list, which was the only job he had.</p>

<p>The committee consisted of two wings: the pro-UCC wing and the anti-UCC wing. The pro-UCC wing consisted primarily of mostly-Hindu BJP MPs, who wanted to take the “best” of the religious laws, abolish the “evil” laws (which includes beef and hijabs) and put them into a uniform code. But unsurprisingly, there was little thought about how such a system could be implemented. </p>

<p>The anti-UCC wing consisted of opposition MPs, mainly Congress MPs who couldn’t seem to agree on a common stance: Rahul Gandhi was against a UCC of any form, while other MPs such as Shashi Tharoor seemed to be in favour of a UCC – just not at this particular point of time. </p>

<p>A concerning development arose early in today’s proceedings, where it was revealed that the pro-UCC wing, led by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, were planning to push their agenda through by the strength of numbers. The pro-UCC bloc was given specific instructions to vote against every single motion, paper and resolution introduced by the anti-UCC bloc, and thereby push their agenda through.</p>

<p>In the General Speakers’ List, the BJP MPs talked about wanting to replace the fragmented laws of different religions with a secular law, and put human rights first. They zeroed in on the Muslim laws they deemed evil, all the while singing praises about how they removed the Triple Talaq Bill. The anti-UCC bloc brought up the issue of minority oppression, and pointed out how it is unfeasible to cater to the needs of all religions. Some MPs, most notably Rahul Gandhi, opposed the UCC purely because in its current state, it was highly polarizing and BJP-centric.</p>

<p>Nitin Gadkari brought up the topic of removing “evil” and “unfair” religious practices from society, and instead of being concerned about the subjectivity of such terms (which Rahul Gandhi of all people rightly pointed out), Akhilesh Yadav was incensed by the usage of “evil” to talk about religious practices, going so far as to raise a “Right to Reply” on the matter. He was quickly gagged, which serves him right for his utter ridiculousness.</p>

<p>Kiren Rijiju was so desperate that he even decided to bring up 1954 Census (1954 - yes, you saw that right) stats into his argument about polygamy rates. These “stats” were brushed away as they were as irrelevant as himself.</p>

<p>After the Speakers’ List, it took ages for the committee to agree on a motion, as the delegates kept bringing up frighteningly long and unfeasible motions. After what seemed like an eternity, they finally agreed on “Alternatives to UCC”.</p>

<p>In this session, while Rahul Gandhi only found it necessary to change in some of the personal laws of different religions, the pro-UCC bloc brought up the redundancy in needing to change these laws in several religions, which made the UCC better in their eyes. They once again brought up the topic of UCC rescuing minorities from persecutive laws of their religions. A notable point was brought up by Shashi Tharoor regarding the need to “convince the leaders of these religions to bring about those changes in their followers.”</p>

<p>But for every reasonable opinion, there was a nonsensical one. Farooq Abdullah suggested that the final call for any change in law “must be taken by the religious authorities” and in case of any conflict, “the religion’s law must be referred to”. In a situation where those very laws are oppressive to the victims, this could lead to devastating consequences.</p>

<p>The track record of one “right to reply” for every formal session continued as on this occasion, Kiren Rijiju viciously attacked Tejaswi Surya, slamming his hypocrisy and his derogatory remarks on women, and brought up certain misogynistic tweets he had made in the past. He commented that Surya has no right to be talking about matters of gender equality and these laws. Tejaswi Surya could come up with no other argument, other than that these arguments were “politically motivated”. He was shunned even by his own bloc and party members, and was swiftly gagged by the committee.</p>

<p>Little noteworthy progress was made in this session, apart from the laying of the groundwork for future session. The author hopes that future sessions are more productive for the sake of the country’s progress.</p>]]></content><author><name>Times of India</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today’s first session of Lok Sabha was like any other – uproars, gagged MPs, blame games, and most importantly, very little productive discussion.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Nitish Kumar Interview</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2022/06/12/nitish.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Nitish Kumar Interview" /><published>2022-06-12T14:45:13+03:00</published><updated>2022-06-12T14:45:13+03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2022/06/12/nitish</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/06/12/nitish.html"><![CDATA[<p>Nitish Kumar finally broke his silence on UCC matters in the 2nd parliamentary session by bashing BJP for trying to implement UCC in Bihar, which according to him isn’t a wise move.</p>

<p>The CM further elaborated that implementing UCC will be disastrous in Bihar as it would instigate the already polarized communities and incite riots. Moreover, he mentioned that implementing UCC will be detrimental towards protecting minorities and would impact freedom of religion.</p>

<p>In the interview, Nitish Kumar mentioned that Bihar is going through a delicate state and he wouldn’t want anything that will tip the fragile balance and lead to violence.</p>

<p>All of this brings out the discord within JDU in recent years. In April 2022, a JDU minister, Ashok Chaudhary, who is Nitish Kumar’s aide said that Bihar didn’t need UCC as the state is very peaceful. </p>

<p>The aforementioned statement was in stark contrast to the CM’s views, and upon being questioned about it, he replied that his opinion differs from those in his own party. This brings up the question - is JDU working towards bringing Bihar out of its “fragile” state, when its own MLAs live in ignorance?</p>

<p>The CM made no comments on the future of UCC in Bihar, but had previously written to the Law Commission regarding the same, in which he pressed that UCC, though useful, must be delayed in Bihar.</p>]]></content><author><name>The Hindu</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nitish Kumar finally broke his silence on UCC matters in the 2nd parliamentary session by bashing BJP for trying to implement UCC in Bihar, which according to him isn’t a wise move.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">UCC, a Tool to Pave the way for a Pro-Hindu Nation?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2022/06/12/UCC.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="UCC, a Tool to Pave the way for a Pro-Hindu Nation?" /><published>2022-06-12T12:45:13+03:00</published><updated>2022-06-12T12:45:13+03:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2022/06/12/UCC</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/06/12/UCC.html"><![CDATA[<p> In today’s Lok Sabha session, delegates debated over the practicality and feasibility of implementing Uniform Civil Code on Indian citizens to change personal laws. After the session, one thing is clear : “Secularism is just a word to hide the hindu nationalist sentiments of the Modi Govt” pointed out by Gaurav Gogoi.</p>

<p>In an issue like this, as clearly stated by Rahul Gandhi, there can be no real neutrality. Some communities will have to bend over in search for uniformity, which will evidently end up being the minority, with a hindu nationalist party being the majority.</p>

<p>Throughout today's session, a multitude of points were raised, both in favour and against India's lack of a UCC. One of the most important points that was raised was “Is the implementation of secularism really secular, if it’s oppressing minorities?” by none other than the president of the INC, Sonia Gandhi. She went on to explain how UCC would be a way to curb religious freedom of minorities, something that is granted to the people by the constitution. This was poorly countered by Jyotiraditya Scindia who stated that the first law reformed by Nehru was a Hindu personal law. </p>

<p>For the BJP, today’s agenda was simple. Overpower the opposition with their overwhelming majority, by backing up every weak point raised by their party. This was seen when there was unanimous voting towards the topic "If not UCC then what?", a motion raised by a BJP member, but when the time came to speak, the response from their side was underwhelming.</p>

<p>Nupur Sharma, the ex spokesperson of the BJP claimed most minority religions had aggressive laws that could only be controlled by the implementation of a UCC. This is days after she was caught making offensive comments about the Muslim Prophet. After that, can we really take what she says as constructive discussion, or is it just Islamophobia?</p>

<p>After debating over whether or not UCC could be implemented, the debate turned to alternatives for the UCC, and whether or not they would be sustainable in a country as vast and diverse as India. Points were raised by Tejasvi Surya, who loudly exclaimed that triple talaq and polygamy were sustainable, before clarifying that he was being “sarcastic”. Asaduddin Owaisi raised questions about “If you are not able to win wars on the borders of our country, why are you trying to start new wars in it”, restating the issue of communal violence. He and Tejasvi Surya had a heated debate about this point, with the former also attacking the latter’s character, to which Tejasvi raised a right to reply, and lost.</p>

<p>Jyotiraditya Scindia tried to come up with ways to implement the UCC, most of which did not hold up under scrutiny. One of the ways was to take the “best of all worlds” while picking and choosing laws, that would be ultimately decided by a separate board. But, would the board be able to represent all the people of India, and not just make laws that represent the majority?</p>

<p>Throughout the first session, BJP leaders were called out multiple times by the Chair for being disruptive and not following decorum, banging the table unnecessarily, raising abusive slogans and overall showing disrespect.</p>

<p>In the second session, Mamta Banerjee spoke about how it is the Modi Govt and “his buddies in RSS” that decide the framework of the UCC. She added that “Throughout our time in the session there has been no point made on how it will be implemented, who would be given that power to alter the laws, what laws would be considered ''wrong”? This lack of information brings us back to believe in the fact that BJP has been known to misuse the law”</p>

<p>After a lot of beating around the bush, Yogi Adityanath finally suggested forming a separate committee which would have a proportional amount of representation of all communities, to which Nitish Kumar aptly replied that it would just be like a subset of the Loksabha. Yogi added that if it were to be implemented, they would do it in a few BJP controlled states, for 3 years. This raises the question of how “uniform” the code actually is.</p>

<p>So what would the BJP actually implementing the UCC imply for minorities in India? Rahul Gandhi raised the problem of Hindus being in majority in the country and would be in the mentioned committee leading to the suppression of the minorities. </p>

<p>For instance, Ramesh Potria suggested to ban the madrasas, which are an integral part of muslim culture and its propagation. Every BJP leader went on and on about Islamic laws and how they would need to be reformed. The opposition retaliated with facts about how the Ramayana and Mahabharata are taught in CBSE schools as a part of their coursework. To this he countered by saying that it was just the “history of the nation”. So in the future, will this enforce the “hindu past” of our nation, with muslims seen as invaders?</p>

<p>These hindu nationalist propagandas of the Modi government lead to uncertainty and fear amongst the minorities.</p>

<p>Is UCC just a cover up for making the whole nation follow hindu personal laws? If UCC is implemented, will India remain a secular nation, or will it turn into a majority dominated state.</p>]]></content><author><name>The Wire</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today’s Lok Sabha session, delegates debated over the practicality and feasibility of implementing Uniform Civil Code on Indian citizens to change personal laws.

Disgruntled, the speaker was forced to allow a break for them to decide.</p>

<p>After a rather weird suggestion of 44 minutes, 2 minutes per speaker by Vijayan, the motion finally decided was that of Yogi Adityanath's - “framework and implementation of UCC”. </p>

<p>The speeches began with Nitin Gadkari who cited discriminatory comments made by MIM's Owaisi and offered to “dumb down” the goals of UCC for him. He elaborated on the origin of UCC, to which the Mahua Maitri asked whether he thought Britishers were superior to Indians for trying to implement a uniform civil code.</p>

<p>Arvind Kejriwal questioned the government on its ethos with BJP's Yogi Adityanath being allegedly communal. It must be noted that the CM also proclaimed “BJP detected, opinion rejected” in the middle of the parliamentary session. He was supported by an opposition member who said that BJP believes in fixing minorities' issues without consulting the minorities themselves.</p>

<p>Further, Nitish Kumar mentioned that he was against UCC despite being a supporter of BJP. He also mentioned that UCC should be implemented uniformly in all states, since it has “uniform” in its name, rather than being implemented in only the BJP ruled states first. Amit Shah responded that implementing it in all states at once would cause communal violence, which hints towards the conclusion that the BJP thinks that the BJP states are less prone to violence.</p>

<p>Owaisi reprimanded the government for repeatedly using Goa as an example of UCC, with Goa being the only state with a uniform civil code. He elaborated that the UCC in Goa had some 2800 articles, with each one laying down different laws for different people, which defeated its purpose.</p>
