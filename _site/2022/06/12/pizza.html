        <p>The first day began with a General Speakers’ List (GSL) with 20 speakers, lasting 30 minutes. The topic of discussion was the Uniform Civil Code(UCC). The first couple of hours consisted of banal back-and-forth between the opposition and the government, with all representatives making the same points – the opposition stating, “you can’t impose your rules on other communities,” and the government enlightening them: “ Many of the personal laws are prejudiced against women in general. Hence, we must have a uniform code to ensure parity for all.”</p>

<p>The opposition mentioned that the implementation of UCC in Goa(a BJP-ruled state) was imperfect and “not actually uniform”, but Minister of Finance Sitharaman sets them straight by womansplaining to them that those laws were brought about by the Portuguese, and honestly it’s unreasonable to blame the current government for them.</p>

<p>Nitin Gadkari asked the pertinent question of human rights taking precedence over all other rights and choice. He said that you can still practise your own religion, but the evil laws should be rid of. This is true even of Hinduism, as in the case of Sati. However, Akhilesh Yadav took offence to Gadkari’s unapologetic usage of the word ‘evil’, raised a right to reply… AND LOST. like a bich. So he had to shut up for 15 minutes</p>

<p>Next up, Manoj Tiwari made an interesting analogy about a son not wanting pizza from Domino’s when asked if he wanted to order online(he compared this with the opposition discussing the implementation of UCC when they hadn’t even decided if UCC would be implemented), and Vijayan responded by saying they don’t want pizza at all. (I know, right? What a weirdo. Whatever. More pizza for the rest of us) The overarching theme seemed to be that the opposition wanted a UCC, but were not in favour of the ruling party formulating it, as their laws were apparently “hInDu-BiAsEd”.</p>

<p>Amidst all this, Yogiji raised his hand to speak, but the rapporteur ignored him >:( that’s strike one.</p>

<p>Shashi Tharoor started talking again, and disrespected Tejaswi Surya. What he didn’t realise was that he had forgotten his haute “accent”. Thanks to the rapporteur for pointing that out. You’re off the hook. For now. We break for an hour.</p>

<p>The topic for the second session is “If not UCC, then what?”</p>

<p>We’re supposed to hear the alternatives the opposition has to a UCC. (Spoiler: none of them are any good)</p>

<p>Rahul Gandhi pipes up, and stumbles through his speech. Elmayo noob. His own associates disturb his speech, showing a lack of unity and coordination in Congress and the opposition as a whole. He takes the metaphor in a completely new (and nonsensical) direction by bringing up pineapple on pizza</p>
