        <p>The session started off in a not-so-positive manner with no valid motion by any of the MPs. Disgruntled, the speaker was forced to allow a break for them to decide.</p>

<p>After a rather weird suggestion of 44 minutes, 2 minutes per speaker by Vijayan, the motion finally decided was that of Yogi Adityanath's - “framework and implementation of UCC”. </p>

<p>The speeches began with Nitin Gadkari who cited discriminatory comments made by MIM's Owaisi and offered to “dumb down” the goals of UCC for him. He elaborated on the origin of UCC, to which the Mahua Maitri asked whether he thought Britishers were superior to Indians for trying to implement a uniform civil code.</p>

<p>Arvind Kejriwal questioned the government on its ethos with BJP's Yogi Adityanath being allegedly communal. It must be noted that the CM also proclaimed “BJP detected, opinion rejected” in the middle of the parliamentary session. He was supported by an opposition member who said that BJP believes in fixing minorities' issues without consulting the minorities themselves.</p>

<p>Further, Nitish Kumar mentioned that he was against UCC despite being a supporter of BJP. He also mentioned that UCC should be implemented uniformly in all states, since it has “uniform” in its name, rather than being implemented in only the BJP ruled states first. Amit Shah responded that implementing it in all states at once would cause communal violence, which hints towards the conclusion that the BJP thinks that the BJP states are less prone to violence.</p>

<p>Owaisi reprimanded the government for repeatedly using Goa as an example of UCC, with Goa being the only state with a uniform civil code. He elaborated that the UCC in Goa had some 2800 articles, with each one laying down different laws for different people, which defeated its purpose.</p>

<p>Rahul Gandhi finally made points related to the motion by highlighting that the government must consider the common ground between religions and the personal laws of different faiths. Sadly, his points were missed as the Lok Sabha erupted in a lot of cross talk.</p>

<p>Pokhriyal made inflammatory remarks about Madrasas and said that the focus on religion brainwashed the youth and denied them the same education as others. Upon being asked about Gurukuls doing the same, he responded that Gurukuls were better at providing the necessary skills and knowledge than Madrasas, which made students in Gurukuls the ideal Indians. </p>
