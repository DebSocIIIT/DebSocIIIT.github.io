        <p>Jyotiraditya Scindia, the Congress member who switched BJP in 2020, was interviewed by The Hindu in the first session of the Parliament today.</p>

<p><i>The interview commenced only after the Rajya Sabha MP glanced through the web to check whether The Hindu’s political alliance lied with the NDA.</i> <b>The Hindu would like to press that we don’t affiliate ourselves with any political entity, Indian or otherwise, and are completely unbiased in our views.</b><p>

<p>In your experience, out of BJP and Congress, which party do you think respects the secular nature of the country?<p>

<p>Scindia replied that he thought BJP was more accommodating of minorities’ opinions. He didn’t comment on the revolts in response to CAA, and other such NDA implemented laws.<p>

<p>Are you aware of some other countries that have implemented UCC? The MP replied that he did. Are you aware of the fact that Saudi Arabia has a uniform civil code? The MP wasn’t. <p>

<p>Countries such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Pakistan and so on, have a uniform code for everyone, but in contrast to the aspirations of the Indian constitution, it has been implemented according to Sharia law.<p>

<p>With reference to the last question, how can the nation trust BJP, a Hindutva party, to implement the UCC while considering the views of everyone? <p>

<p>The MP reiterated the government’s plans to have equal representation from all communities and proportional representation from the parliamentary members. Scindia added that the one of the main goals of UCC was to ensure equal rights for all women in the country and uphold the dignity of females. <p>

<p>What would you like to comment on Ramesh Pokhriyal saying that education in gurukuls produced the ideal Indians and education in madrasas brainwashed the youth?<p>

<p>The MP didn’t comment and provided the excuse of not being present in the parliament house when the inflammatory comment was made.<p>

<p>In your speech in the first session, you mentioned that India should follow the Belgium model. Could you elaborate on that?<p>

<p>Jyotiraditya Scindia mentioned the key characteristics of the Belgian problem - different language speaking majorities and special community governments that had the power to handle issues related, and address grievances, related to their own communities. <p>

<p>In Belgium, the communal governments have power over educational, cultural, and language related issues. Bar marriage related issues, isn’t this the same as personal laws in India? <p>

<p>The MP evaded the question and reiterated the point of a UCC. <p>

<p>In 2014, you mentioned that BJP polarizes the Indian community and damages the secular nature of our country. What has changed between then and 2022?<p>

<p>Scindia mentioned that opinions and facts change with time.<p>

<p>How do you feel about the fact that you rub shoulders with the same people who were present in the BJP when you made the previous comment?<p>

<p>The MP replied that opinions and people are allowed to change.<p>
